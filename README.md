## Installation

Create `.env` file in root folder like `.env-template`.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` uses [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to start react app and [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) in the same time. This will not be needed in production.

Simple as that.
